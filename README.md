Xamarin.Forms Android/iOS barcode scanner

Implement a system for working with products on barcode for Android and Ios.
Technology Requirements: Xamarin
The main functionality:
• The page with the list of conditional goods (for example, “Product 1”, ..., “Product N”. With which we work with the directory of goods.) The product parameter is the conditional name, conditional photo, barcode.
• Product search page. On the search page using the camera, we read the barcode, look for the product and display a window with the product parameters (photo and name).
If the item is not found, a message is displayed with the numeric data of the barcode read.
The result of the task should be two working applications in the form of apk and ipa.
